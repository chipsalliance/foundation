# Joining Groups.io

The CHIPS Alliance uses [Groups.io for our mailing lists](https://lists.chipsalliance.org).  If you are unfamiliar with how to join, this tutorial will walk you through the process.

At a high level, Groups.io is organized as one main list (usually called "main") which is subdivided into smaller groups.  Each subgroup is indepdendent from the other.  When we talk about mailing lists, we're actually referring to subgroups.

### Step 1) Join a mailing list

The first step is to join any mailing list.  For CHIPS Alliance, you can find that at [https://lists.chipsalliance.org](https://lists.chipsalliance.org).  Click "Subgroups" on the left, and choose a group, such as "announce".  Please note, joining only "main" won't do anything, because **we never send emails to "main"**.

Once you've clicked a group, scroll down to the blue "Join This Group" button.

Once you click the join button, add your email address and click "Confirm Email Address".  You'll receive an email with a confirmation link, which you should click.  You can then optionally set a password.

### Step 2) Join other mailing lists

Once you've confirmed your email, go back to [https://lists.chipsalliance.org](https://lists.chipsalliance.org), and click "Subgroups".

You can now join any other mailing list, although please note that some mailing lists for members require you to request approval to join.

## Managing your subscriptions

If you want to join additional groups, return to [https://lists.chipsalliance.org](https://lists.chipsalliance.org) and log in through the link at the top right.

If you don't remember your password, you can choose "Email me a link to log in".  When you enter the email address you used to subscribe, you will receive an email with a magic link that will log you into [https://lists.chipsalliance.org](https://lists.chipsalliance.org).

At this point, you can click "Subgroups" on the left and subscribe/unsubscribe to other lists.

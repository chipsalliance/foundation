# The CHIPS Alliance

The [CHIPS Alliance](https://chipsalliance.org) develops high-quality, open source hardware designs and open source hardware design tools relevant to silicon devices and FPGAs.

By creating an open and collaborative environment, the CHIPS Alliance shares resources to lower the cost of development.
Companies and individuals can work together to develop open source CPUs, various peripherals, complex IP blocks, tools and workflows.

The CHIPS Alliance is open to all organizations who are interested in collaborating on open source hardware or software tools to accelerate the creation of more efficient and innovative chip designs.

The CHIPS Alliance is hosted by [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org), a 501(c)6 non-profit.
